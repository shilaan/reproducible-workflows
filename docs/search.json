    "text": "2.1 Reconstruction of data\nData were drawn from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) at the UCLA Higher Education Research Institute (HERI), using the Senior Survey (1998). A subsample was created that excluded 2-year colleges and universities, historically Black colleges and universities, and students and institutions with preestablished thresholds of missing cases or items; the authors excluded students who had missing data or marked other on race, and institutions with fewer than 15 respondents.\nData was obtained from the HERI Data Archives (https://heri.ucla.edu/heri-data-archive/) for academics. This data is part of the public archives for scholarly access. It should not be posted publicly; instead, interested researchers should navigate to https://heri.ucla.edu/data-archive/ to register for the data archive and download the data there.\nVariables obtained from the 1998 Senior survey:\n\nGender (1 = female)\nRace (five dummy variables: African American, Native American, Asian American, Latino, and White)\nControl, 0 = public institution, 1 = private institution\nPart-time job on campus (1 = marked)\nLevel of involvement (1 = marked, standardized). Index of student responses on three items about whether or not they joined a fraternity or sorority; student government; or racial-ethnic organization\nCurricular diversity (1 = marked, standardized). Index of student responses on three items about whether or not they have participated in the following activities since entering college:\n\nTaken an ethnic studies course\nAttended a racial-cultural awareness workshop\nParticipated in an ethnic-racial student organization\n\nNB: “Participated in an ethnic/racial student organization” is an item for both level of involvement and curricular diversity\n\n\nCross-racial interaction (standardized). Coded on a 3-point scale from 1 = not at all to 3 = frequently. Responses to “At the college you entered as a freshman, indicate how often you…”\n\nInteracted with someone of a different racial-ethnic group in class\nStudied with someone from a different racial-ethnic group\nDined with someone from a different racial-ethnic group\nDated someone from a different racial-ethnic group\nSocialized with someone from a different racial-ethnic group\n\nNB: I cannot find the first item (interacted in class) in the data archives\n\n\nSelf-efficacy (standardized). Coded on a 5-point scale from 1 = lowest 10% to 5 = highest 10%. Includes following traits:\n\nDrive to achieve\nSelf-confidence (intellectual)\nCompetitiveness\nAcademic ability\nWriting ability\n\nNB: Appendix A seems to suggest that this outcome measure is standardized by age (“comparing with the average person the student’s age”), but I’m not entirely sure\n\n\nGeneral academic skills (standardized). Coded on a 5-point scale from 1 = lowest 10% to 5 = highest 10%. Includes following traits:\n\nAcademic ability\nWriting ability\n\nAppendix A seems to suggest that this pretest measure is standardized by age (“comparing with the average person the student’s age”), but I’m not entirely sure\nTable 1 footnote b indicates that this was actually coded from 1 = much weaker to 5 = much stronger (not 1 = lowest 10% to 5 = highest 10%)\nThese two items are also a part of the self-efficacy measure above\n\n\nRacial-cultural engagement (standardized).

However, SES is mentioned nowhere in the paper: not in the outcome tables, the descriptive statistics, or in the description of the methods and measures (so I do not know where/how to get or calculate this measure). I’m assuming this is a remnant of a previous version of the paper, and that SES is not actually included in the final model. Thus, I do not include SES in the reproduction attempt.\nSecond, the college and student identifiers seem to have been recoded over time (i.e., they are not constant across different yearly iterations of the Survey). As a result, I cannot merge the Survey with outside institution-level data (i.e., undergraduate enrollment and % of URM students), nor merge the 1998 Survey with previous iterations to obtain the covariates measured in earlier years (i.e., pretests of the three outcomes, high school GPA, and on-campus residency).\nIn sum, I do not have access to the following covariates mentioned in the paper:\n\nSize of college (undergraduate enrollment)\nSelectivity (Average SAT Verbal and SAT Math scores of entering freshmen)\n%of underrepresented minority (URM) students: %Hispanic + %Black + %Native American\n\nWhile I do not have access to the overall % of URM students for each institution, I can calculate this percentage for the survey respondents and still include this measure\n\nPretest of outcome\nHighschool GPA\nLive on campus (yes/no)\n\nTaking these discrepancies into account, I run the following statistical model:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_{ij} = ~&\\gamma_{00} + \\gamma_{01}(\\text{AVG: URM}) + \\gamma_{04} (\\text{Control: Private}) + \\gamma_{05} (\\text{AVG: Curricular diversity}) +  \\\\\n&\\gamma_{06}(\\text{AVG: CRI}) +\\gamma_{07}(\\text{AVG: Part-time job on campus}) + \\gamma_{012}(\\text{AVG: Female}) +  \\\\\n&\\gamma_{013}(\\text{AVG: Involvement}) +  \\gamma_{10}(\\text{Curricular diversity}) + \\gamma_{11}(\\text{Curricular diversity}*\\text{AVG: URM}) + \\\\\n&\\gamma_{12}(\\text{Curricular diversity}*\\text{AVG: Curricular diversity}) +  \\gamma_{13}(\\text{Curricular diversity}*\\text{AVG: CRI}) +  \\\\\n&\\gamma_{14}(\\text{Curricular diversity}*\\text{AVG: Part-time job on campus}) +  \\gamma_{20}(\\text{CRI}) + \\\\\n&\\gamma_{21}(\\text{CRI}*\\text{AVG: URM}) + \\gamma_{22}(\\text{CRI}*\\text{AVG: Curricular diversity}) +  \\gamma_{23}(\\text{CRI}*\\text{AVG: CRI}) + \\\\\n& \\beta_{3j}(\\text{Part-time job on campus}) + \\beta_{8j}(\\text{Native American}) + \\beta_{9j}(\\text{Asian}) +  \\beta_{10j}(\\text{African American}) + \\\\\n&\\beta_{11j}(\\text{Hispanic}) +  \\beta_{12j}(\\text{Female}) + \\beta_{13j}(\\text{Involvement})\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nrun_lmer &lt;- function(outcome) {\n  lmer(\n  outcome ~\n    #g01*AVG:URM + g04*Private + g05*AVG_curricular_div + g_06*AVG:CRI\n    urm_mean + private + curricular_diversity_mean + cross_racial_int_mean +\n    #g07*AVG:Part_time + g012*AVG:Female + g013*AVG:involvement + \n    part_time_job_mean + female_mean + involvement_mean + \n    #g10*curricular_div + g11*curricular_div*AVG:URM + \n    curricular_diversity + curricular_diversity*urm_mean + \n    #g12*curricular_div*AVG:curricular_div\n    curricular_diversity*curricular_diversity_mean + \n    #g13*curricular_div*AVG:CRI\n    curricular_diversity*cross_racial_int_mean +\n    #g14*curricular_div*AVG:Part time\n    curricular_diversity*part_time_job_mean +\n    #g20*CRI   +     g21*CRI*AVG:URM + \n    cross_racial_int + cross_racial_int*urm_mean + \n    #g22*CRI*AVG:curricular_div\n    cross_racial_int*curricular_diversity_mean + \n    #g23*CRI*AVG:CRI         +               b3j*part_time + b8j*native\n    cross_racial_int*cross_racial_int_mean + part_time_job + native +\n    #b9j*asian + b10j*black + b11j*hispanic + b12j*female + b13*involvement\n    asian + black + hispanic + female + involvement +\n    #random intercept for college\n    (1 | acerecode),\n  data = df,\n  verbose = FALSE\n  )\n}\n\n#Run models for the three outcomes\nfit_efficacy &lt;- run_lmer(df$self_efficacy) %&gt;% tidy()\nfit_academic &lt;- run_lmer(df$academic_skills) %&gt;% tidy()\nfit_engagement &lt;- run_lmer(df$racial_engagement) %&gt;% tidy()\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Analyst success criteria\nAbove, I described two important discrepancies between the original paper and my reproduction attempt: (1) I do not have access to college size; college selectivity; pretests of the outcomes; highschool GPA; and whether students live on campus and (2) I rely on a self-calculated percentage of URM students, based on the survey respondents.\nThese covariates likely impact the coefficient estimates, but we can still evaluate if the main predictors (curricular diversity and cross-racial interactions) are significant, with an effect in the same direction. Thus, the analyst success criteria below are relatively broad: for each claim, I evaluate whether (1) the p-value approximately reproduces and (2) the coefficient estimate is of the same sign."

As can be seen, both models suggest that p values play a crucial role in the distribution of effect sizes reported in Vohs et al. (2006) and Caruso et al. (2013), and in Tables 1 and 2 from Vohs (2015), but much less so in the Rohrer et al. (2015) and Klein et al. (2014) data. The best models of the former data sets are ones in which studies yielding p values greater than .1 are virtually guaranteed to be excluded…selection models yield nonflat weight functions when the proportion of nonsignificant results is implausibly low given the observed distribution of effect sizes and sample sizes. Thus, the weight functions depicted in Figure 3 show that a distribution of results like the one presented by Vohs is unlikely to have arisen in the absence of selection bias.
