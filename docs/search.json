However, SES is mentioned nowhere in the paper: not in the outcome tables, the descriptive statistics, or in the description of the methods and measures (so I do not know where/how to get or calculate this measure). I’m assuming this is a remnant of a previous version of the paper, and that SES is not actually included in the final model. Thus, I do not include SES in the reproduction attempt.\nSecond, the college and student identifiers seem to have been recoded over time (i.e., they are not constant across different yearly iterations of the Survey). As a result, I cannot merge the Survey with outside institution-level data (i.e., undergraduate enrollment and % of URM students), nor merge the 1998 Survey with previous iterations to obtain the covariates measured in earlier years (i.e., pretests of the three outcomes, high school GPA, and on-campus residency).\nIn sum, I do not have access to the following covariates mentioned in the paper:\n\nSize of college (undergraduate enrollment)\nSelectivity (Average SAT Verbal and SAT Math scores of entering freshmen)\n%of underrepresented minority (URM) students: %Hispanic + %Black + %Native American\n\nWhile I do not have access to the overall % of URM students for each institution, I can calculate this percentage for the survey respondents and still include this measure\n\nPretest of outcome\nHighschool GPA\nLive on campus (yes/no)\n\nTaking these discrepancies into account, I run the following statistical model:\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\nY_{ij} = &\\gamma_{00} + \\gamma_{01}(\\text{AVG: URM}) + \\gamma_{04} (\\text{Control: Private}) + \\gamma_{05} (\\text{AVG: Curricular diversity}) + \\gamma_{06}(\\text{AVG: CRI}) + \\\\\n&\\gamma_{07}(\\text{AVG: Part-time job on campus}) + \\gamma_{012}(\\text{AVG: Female}) +  \\gamma_{013}(\\text{AVG: Involvement}) + \\\\\n& \\gamma_{10}(\\text{Curricular diversity}) + \\gamma_{11}(\\text{Curricular diversity}*\\text{AVG: URM}) + \\gamma_{12}(\\text{Curricular diversity}*\\text{AVG: Curricular diversity}) + \\\\\n&  \\gamma_{13}(\\text{Curricular diversity}*\\text{AVG: CRI}) +  \\gamma_{14}(\\text{Curricular diversity}*\\text{AVG: Part-time job on campus}) + \\\\\n& \\gamma_{20}(\\text{CRI}) + \\gamma_{21}(\\text{CRI}*\\text{AVG: URM}) + \\gamma_{22}(\\text{CRI}*\\text{AVG: Curricular diversity}) +  \\gamma_{23}(\\text{CRI}*\\text{AVG: CRI}) + \\\\\n& \\beta_{3j}(\\text{Part-time job on campus}) + \\beta_{8j}(\\text{Native American}) + \\beta_{9j}(\\text{Asian}) +  \\beta_{10j}(\\text{African American}) + \\beta_{11j}(\\text{Hispanic}) + \\\\\n& \\beta_{12j}(\\text{Female}) + \\beta_{13j}(\\text{Involvement})\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nrun_lmer &lt;- function(outcome) {\n  lmer(\n  outcome ~\n    #g01*AVG:URM + g04*Private + g05*AVG_curricular_div + g_06*AVG:CRI\n    urm_mean + private + curricular_diversity_mean + cross_racial_int_mean +\n    #g07*AVG:Part_time + g012*AVG:Female + g013*AVG:involvement + \n    part_time_job_mean + female_mean + involvement_mean + \n    #g10*curricular_div + g11*curricular_div*AVG:URM + \n    curricular_diversity + curricular_diversity*urm_mean + \n    #g12*curricular_div*AVG:curricular_div\n    curricular_diversity*curricular_diversity_mean + \n    #g13*curricular_div*AVG:CRI\n    curricular_diversity*cross_racial_int_mean +\n    #g14*curricular_div*AVG:Part time\n    curricular_diversity*part_time_job_mean +\n    #g20*CRI   +     g21*CRI*AVG:URM + \n    cross_racial_int + cross_racial_int*urm_mean + \n    #g22*CRI*AVG:curricular_div\n    cross_racial_int*curricular_diversity_mean + \n    #g23*CRI*AVG:CRI         +               b3j*part_time + b8j*native\n    cross_racial_int*cross_racial_int_mean + part_time_job + native +\n    #b9j*asian + b10j*black + b11j*hispanic + b12j*female + b13*involvement\n    asian + black + hispanic + female + involvement +\n    #random intercept for college\n    (1 | acerecode),\n  data = df,\n  verbose = FALSE\n  )\n}\n\n#Run models for the three outcomes\nfit_efficacy &lt;- run_lmer(df$self_efficacy) %&gt;% tidy()\nfit_academic &lt;- run_lmer(df$academic_skills) %&gt;% tidy()\nfit_engagement &lt;- run_lmer(df$racial_engagement) %&gt;% tidy()\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Analyst success criteria\nAbove, I described two important discrepancies between the original paper and my reproduction attempt: (1) I do not have access to college size; college selectivity; pretests of the outcomes; highschool GPA; and whether students live on campus and (2) I rely on a self-calculated percentage of URM students, based on the survey respondents.\nThese covariates likely impact the coefficient estimates, but we can still evaluate if the main predictors (curricular diversity and cross-racial interactions) are significant, with an effect in the same direction. Thus, the analyst success criteria below are relatively broad: for each claim, I evaluate whether (1) the p-value approximately reproduces and (2) the coefficient estimate is of the same sign."
